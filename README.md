### :relaxed: Hello! My name is Lenika 

 <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=lenikanuffer" alt="page views">

üè† I am based in Berlin, Germany.

üé® I am a visual artist, and aspiring Frontend developer.

I would love to collaborate on projects related to plants :herb:, animals :ram:, and mental health.

I can work in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React using libraries and frameworks. Besides, I know how to work on Figma, Storybook, and Adobe Photoshop and InDesign.

I am currently working on Buenamano's website (An amazing ice cream factory in Chile, owned by two amazing friends!). I will be publishing it soon!

You can contact me by <a href="mailto:nufferlenika@gmail.com"><b>email</b></a>.
